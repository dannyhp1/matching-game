# Memory Matching Game
A simple matching game made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

# Purpose
This projected allowed me to develop basic skills in HTML and CSS and learn the syntax of JS.

# Features
- Users can click on the same card (the card will just reflip).
- When the user completes a match, a sound will play.

# Future Plans
- Upon completion of the game, users will be prompted on whether they want to play again or not.
- Add a timer to the game.
  - Allow the user to select the difficulty, timer decreases as difficulty increases.
- Expand the game to having more cards.
